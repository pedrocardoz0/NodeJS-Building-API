# Express HTTP - Using CRUD
-----

### *Basic ideas*

* #### **GET** - *It is used when data fetching is required from the server for representation on the client-side.  *
* #### **POST** -* It is used when the request is sent through forms secretly. The server accepts data in the request as a new entity identified by URI.*
* #### **PUT** - *It is used to store and update data. If an object exists already, it updates or modifies it. If the object does not exist, it creates new one.*
* #### **DELETE** - *It is used to delete data from the server.*
